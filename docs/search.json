Also, rehearse your video and make sure you present clearly and understandably throughout the (very short) presentation. Make clear choices about what to include - that’s key. Do not just show us everything you did.\nA stronger grade will be associated with doing the tasks we’ve discussed more effectively. Adding a lot of additional and unnecessary analyses/work without editing down to the important issues will not improve your grade, but rather have the opposite effect.

As part of the selection process, you should be developing appropriate research questions that lead to the identification of smart measures of interest (from those available) for predictors and outcomes in our Analyses. See the Project A Plan page in these instructions for more on creating appropriate research questions.\nYou must select five different variables from Table B, as described below.\n\nVariable 1 will be your outcome for Analysis 1. It should be a measure describing some aspect of a community’s health, rather than a demographic characteristic. Variables listed in Table B as Analysis 1 or 2 (predictor) should not be used as outcomes for either Analysis 1 or 2. As a result, you will be choosing one of these 20 variables for your Analysis 1 outcome:\n\nv001, v002, v009, v011, v036, v042, v044, v049, v050, v060, v067, v070, v125, v127, v136, v139, v140, v143, v155, or v166.\n\nVariable 2 will be your predictor for Analysis 1, so the relationship between variables 1 and 2 should be of interest to you.\n\nYou can select any of the 30 variables in Table B for your Analysis 1 predictor.\n\nVariable 3 will be your outcome for Analysis 2. Like variable 1, it should describe some aspect of a community’s health, rather than just its demographics.\n\nYou can select any of the 20 variables eligible to be your Analysis 1 outcome as your Analysis 2 outcome.\n\nVariable 4 (after you categorize it, later) will be your predictor for Analysis 2. Again, the relationship between variables 3 and 4 should be of interest.\n\nYou can select any of the 30 variables in Table B for your Analysis 2 predictor.\n\nVariable 5 is your Analysis 3 outcome, which you will compare to its CHR 2019 value in the County Health Rankings data. This is restricted a bit more, and Table B shows 10 options for Analysis 3.\n\nThese 10 options are: v009, v011, v036, v042, v049, v060, v070, v127, v139, or v143.\n\n\nRemember that each of your five selections must be a different variable."

Do not use v001 and v127 in the same Analysis.\nA serious look at the impact of race/ethnicity is beyond the scope of Project A. If you are interested in studying race and ethnicity and their impact on a health outcome, we suggest using v126, (or its inverse, 1 - v126), to incorporate this dimension as a predictor. This is because there’s more variation in the v126 data across the reported counties than other variables describing race or ethnicity.\nThe brief label from CHR column in Table B are shown in the first (deleted in R) row in the raw .csv file for 2025, and are also specified in the 2025 CHR Data Dictionary PDF file.\nA key issue for developing these variables is correctly specifying the units of measurement (note that the indexes don’t have units) so that you should be careful to note that in selecting your variables."

Numerical Summaries\nYou will do four things here.\n\n5.10.1 Section 10.1 Table of States by Binary Factor\nFirst, use the tabyl() function from the janitor package to produce a two-way table of state (in the rows) classified against the factor variable (with levels Low and High, plus some missing values, in the columns) that you created in Data Task 4 from the Data page.\n\nBe sure to include both row and column marginal totals in your tabyl() result here.\nWe should see some missing values in the columns.\n\n\n\n5.10.2 Section 10.2 describe_distribution() results\nNext, display the results of describe_distribution() from the datawizard package (from the easystats meta-package), run on the entire tibble.\n\nFor all variables except the two factors, this will allow us to see (among other things) that the minimum and maximum values that make sense, and also that each of your variables shows the appropriate number of counties.\n\n\n\n5.10.3 Section 10.3 data_codebook() results\nNext, run the data_codebook() function from the datawizard package from easystats on your tibble, with two specific settings (max_values = 6 and range_at = 15), as shown below.\n\ndata_codebook(chr_2025, max_values = 6, range_at = 15)\n\nLook over these results to be sure that:\n\nall of your planned outcome and quantitative predictor variables show a minimum and maximum value,\nyou have no more than 20% missing values in either of your Analysis 1 variables, your Analysis 2 outcome and also your Analysis 3 outcome (in each year)\nand that your data are missing only where they are supposed to be missing.\n\nSpecifically, you have no missing data at all in your identifying variables (fipscode, state, county) nor in your county_clustered variable.\nYour binary factor should definitely have about 20% missing values, of course, since that’s how you created it.\n\n\nInclude a sentence verifying that all of these checks are true.\n\n\n5.10.4 Section 10.4 Distinct Values\nFourth and finally, provide counts of distinct values for each of your variables. The following code should be helpful:\n\nchr_2025 |&gt; \n  summarise(across(everything(), ~ n_distinct(.))) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n\nBe sure to check this output to see that:\n\nyou have a distinct fipscode for every row in your tibble, and\nyou have at least 15 unique values for each outcome and for the quantitative predictors in your analyses,\nwe can see all of the results in your HTML output.\n\nInclude a sentence verifying that these checks are true."

    "text": "5.12 Section 12. Your Research Questions\nIn this section, you will provide three research questions, one each for Analysis 1, Analysis 2, and Analysis 3. It would help to provide one subsections for each Analysis within this section, so that Section 12.1 is Analysis 1, Section 12.2 is Analysis 2, and Section 12.3 is Analysis 3.\nFor each analysis …\n\nStart by describing what you want to study, and then specify a research question (which should end with a question mark and be something you can resolve with the planned analysis.)\nDon’t boil the ocean here. You’re looking for a research question that can be reasonably addressed using your data, so it has to be pretty straightforward.\nIf you have a pre-existing belief about what will happen, before you look at the data, please feel encouraged to include a statement about that belief before specifying your question.\n\n\n5.12.1 Your Research Question for Analysis 1\nHere you will propose your Research Question for Analysis 1 and provide some motivation for your variable choices associated with that analysis. A trio of well-developed research questions in this section is the most important part of this portfolio.\n\nA research question will end with a question mark, and will be something you will be able to answer (or at least respond to effectively) after your Analysis 1 is complete.\nUse one research question for Analysis 1, another for Analysis 2, and a third for Analysis 3.\n\nAfter listing your question, you should provide some brief speculation as to the nature of the relationship you anticipate finding based on your hypotheses about the variables you plan to study (following my tips below.)\n\n5.12.1.1 Tips for the research question in Analysis 1\n\nExamples of dull but moderately effective and minimally appropriate research questions for Analysis 1 would be:\n\nHow well does a linear model using [predictor] predict [outcome], in [number] counties in the states of [list of your states]?\nor\nWhat is the nature of the association between [predictor] and [outcome], in [number] counties in the states of [list of your states]?\n\nYou should be able to do better than that, especially if you have a reason to believe something in advance about the direction or strength of the association you are anticipating.\nHowever, if you’re struggling, using that format will be OK.\nA research question uses formal but clear language.\nGiven your planned analyses, stay away from statements about cause and effect, and don’t use the words correlate or regression (in any form) in your research question.\n\n\n\n\n5.12.2 Research Question for Analysis 2\nHere you will propose your Research Question for Analysis 2 and provide some motivation for your variable choices associated with that analysis. All of the tips for Analysis 1 apply in this case, too.\n\nPlease remember that a research question for this course should end in a question mark.\nAgain, after listing your question, it is completely appropriate for you to provide some brief speculation as to the nature of the relationship you anticipate finding based on your hypotheses about the variables you plan to study.\nAn example of a dull but moderately effective and minimally appropriate research question for Analysis 2 might be:\n\nAre there meaningful differences in the mean of [outcome] for counties with high and low levels of [predictor]?\nAgain, you should be able to do a bit better than that.\n\n\n5.12.3 Research Question for Analysis 3\nHere you will propose your Research Question for Analysis 3, and provide some motivation for your variable choices associated with that analysis. All of the tips for Analysis 1 apply in this case, too.\n\nPlease remember that a research question for this course should end in a question mark.\nAgain, after listing your question, it is completely appropriate for you to provide some brief speculation as to the nature of the relationship you anticipate finding based on your hypotheses about the variables you plan to study.\nAn example of a dull but moderately effective and minimally appropriate research question for Analysis 3 might be:\n\nAre there meaningful differences in the mean of [outcome] for counties in 2025 as compared to 2019?\nAgain, you should be able to do a bit better than that."

    "text": "7.1 Checklist: Review Elements for The Project A Plan\nIn 2024, what did we look for in order to ACCEPT the Project A Plan, rather than require a REDO? The list of elements follows. We will probably look at most of these things again in 2025.\n\n7.1.1 Element A. The complete Project A Plan is submitted on time.\n\nIf it’s 1-24 hours late, it will be reviewed later than those received on time, and penalized for lateness.\nIf you worked with a partner, both names are shown as authors in the HTML. Exactly one of you has submitted the materials to Canvas, while the other partner has submitted a text document (Word or PDF is fine) to Canvas that reads: “My name is [YOUR NAME]. I am working on Project A with [INSERT FULL NAME OF YOUR PARTNER], and they will submit the materials for the Plan.”\nThe R data set (analytic tibble), Quarto (.qmd) file, and HTML result are all present in the submission to Canvas.\nThe Quarto file produces the HTML file without errors when we run it. (Note: warnings or messages are OK, but it has to work.)\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Element B. Template, Title, Author(s) and Date show we want to see in the HTML.\n\nThere is a real title that does not include “Project”, “Plan”, “Project A” or “431” in it, but is correctly spelled, and fits in the available space in the HTML.\nThe title is no more than 80 characters in length, excluding any subtitles.\nThe title (without the subtitle) describes the work effectively on its own.\nThe author(s) name(s) appears in the HTML correctly.\nThe date is properly formatted (as, for instance, 2024-09-30) under the word PUBLISHED or MODIFIED in the HTML.\nThere is a table of contents which appears in the HTML and has exactly 14 sections, whose names match those used in the Project A Plan Template.\nWhen we click on the table of contents in the HTML to visit the session information (Section 14), it works.\n\n\n\n7.1.3 Element C. (Plan Section 1. R Packages)\n\nThe janitor, naniar, easystats and tidyverse packages and perhaps other packages are loaded with library() as part of section 1, with the tidyverse loaded last.\nNo packages in the core tidyverse (all of which load with library(tidyverse)) are loaded separately. The core tidyverse packages are dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr and forcats.\nNo package is loaded more than once.\n#| message: false is used in the code chunk for Section 1 so that all messages associated with package loading are silenced.\n\n\n\n7.1.4 Element D. (Plan Section 2. Data Ingest)\n\nThe data should be ingested into chr_2025_raw using read_csv() and thus creating a tibble, while eliminating the correct row, as described in Data Task 1 from the Data page.\nThe chr_2025_raw tibble is then filtered to the ranked counties properly, and the resulting tibble should display 3088 rows and 90 columns (we suggest using the dim() function to verify that this is true.)\n\n\n\n7.1.5 Element E. (Plan Section 3: State Selection)\n\nThe six states selected are clearly indicated by postal abbreviation code and name, following the instructions in Data Task 2.\nThere is a clear English sentence (or two) describing why you selected the states you selected.\nYou then filter the tibble to include only the ranked counties from your six states, and you demonstrate that this leads to a total number of counties between 300 and 800. (This should be demonstrated in code, and with a sentence.)\nNo counties are dropped from the states you selected.\n\n\n\n7.1.6 Element F. (Plan Section 4: Variable Selection)\n\nYou have followed the instructions in Data Task 3 to develop code that identifies and selects nine variables, including the four that are required (fipscode, county, state and county_clustered), and five more (each of which are different) that you have selected.\nAll five of your selected variables are permitted for the use you’re making of them, as specified in Data Task 3 Table B.\n\n\n\n7.1.7 Element G. (Plan Section 5: Variable Cleaning and Renaming)\n\nYou have followed the instructions in Data Task 3 to complete appropriate cleaning of each variable that needs it, and replacement of the initial versions of these variables with your cleaned alternative.\nYou have clearly indicated in Section 5 what role each outcome will play, and its initial name (from CHR 2025) along with its new name and description.\n\n\n\n7.1.8 Element H. (Plan Section 6: Creating the Analysis 2 Predictor)\n\nYou have followed the instructions in Data Task 4 to develop the binary factor you will use as your Analysis 2 predictor.\nYou have clearly identified the variable being used, and described the exact cut points you used to create the low and high groups in one or two complete English sentences.\nYou demonstrate using code that approximately 40% of your observations are in the low group and 40% are in the high group, with missing results for the middle 20%.\n\n\n\n7.1.9 Element I. (Plan Section 7: Adding CHR 2019 Data for the Analysis 3 Outcome)\n\nYou have followed the instructions in Data Task 5 to include the 2019 version of your Analysis 3 outcome in your tibble.\nYou have used left_join() to join the files.\nYou have renamed the two variables (2025 version and 2019 version) appropriately.\n\n\n\n7.1.10 Element J. (Plan Section 8: Arranging and Saving the Analytic Tibble)\n\nYou have arranged the variables in the order specified in Data Task 6.\nThe resulting Rds file is saved to a file called chr_2025_YOURNAME.Rds where your name is substituted in for YOURNAME, and which is part of your Canvas submission.\n\n\n\n7.1.11 Element K. (Plan Section 9: Print the Tibble)\n\nYou print the tibble by typing in chr_2025, with no other code.\nThe resulting tibble is a tibble which shows the first 10 rows, and appropriate labels for your columns.\nThe types of variables listed should match our expectations, specifically: fipscode and county are character variables, state and your Analysis 2 binary predictor are factors, and the other 7 variables are numeric (double-precision).\n\n\n\n7.1.12 Element L. (Plan Section 10: Numerical Summaries)\n\nIn section 10.1, you’ve run code successfully to do what is asked of you (Table of States by Binary Factor). In particular, you’ve used tabyl() properly, and show row and column marginal totals, including for missing values of your binary predictor. Explanatory text is welcome but not required in this section.\nIn section 10.2, you’ve run describe_distribution() properly on the entire tibble, as asked of you. Explanatory text is welcome but not required in this section.\nIn section 10.3, you’ve run data_codebook() properly on the whole data set, using the settings max_values = 6, range_at = 15) without any errors or warnings happening, as requested. You then include at least one English sentence to verify the issues described there, specifically regarding whether the minimum and maximum values of the quantitative data elements make sense, and that the amount of missingness meets our requirements for each variable.\nIn section 10.4, you’ve provided counts of distinct values, as requested and we can see the results for all eleven variables. You also have a sentence or two showing that the checks of distinct fipscodes (a unique code for each row) and at least 15 unique values for each of the outcomes and the quantitative predictor exist.\n\n\n\n7.1.13 Element M. (Plan Section 11: The Codebook)\n\nYou have a sentence stating the number of counties (should be 300-800) and variables (should be eleven) in your tibble. If we use the dim() function, we should get the same answer you did.\nYou have an attractively formatted, readable codebook that looks nice in your HTML which contains all five required parts for each of the 11 variables in your data, as specified. The five required columns of the table are the variable’s (1) name in your tibble, (2) its role, (3) its original vXXX code, (4) the definition (including units) and (5) the year(s) in which the variable was measured.\n\n\n\n7.1.14 Element N. (Plan Section 12: Research Questions)\n\nYou have carefully followed the detailed advice provided in Section 12 of the Plan Instructions.\nFor each of the three Analyses, you provide a clear research question which is written using appropriate syntax and grammar and ends with a question mark.\nYour proposed research question for each Analysis matches the task for that Analysis.\nYou have included a statement about your pre-data analysis belief about what will happen for Analysis 1, at least.\n\n\n\n7.1.15 Element O. (Plan Section 13: Plan Reflection)\n\nYour reflection is a paragraph describing the most challenging (or difficult) part of completing the work so far, and how you were able to overcome whatever it was that was most challenging.\nYour paragraph is written in strong and clear English sentences, with attention paid to grammar, syntax and spelling.\nIt is clear to us from reading the reflection what your biggest issue was, and how you tried to address it.\n\n\n\n7.1.16 Element P. (Plan Section 14: AI Usage)\n\nWe want to see complete sentences here.\n\n\n\n7.1.17 Element Q. (Plan Section 15: Session Information)\n\nWe would prefer that this indicates that R version 4.4.1. is used. If you cannot use R 4.4.1, you should describe a meaningful reason to us here.\nWe’re OK with either the xfun or sessioninfo package’s session information function, but prefer xfun()\n\n\n\n7.1.18 Element R. (Miscellaneous)\n\nThere are no more than 2 spelling, typographical or grammatical errors in the document as a whole that we catch. Please run a spell check by hitting F7 on your Quarto before rendering it a final time, and then look at your HTML file to see if any of the headings, graphs or other elements look strange or don’t show up.\nNo package is loaded outside of Section 1.\nNo non-tibble data frame should ever be printed in Project A.\nNo tibble should be printed anywhere other than in Plan Section 9.\nYou make no changes to the tibble after Section 8."
